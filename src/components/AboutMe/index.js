        I'm clearly very interested in space technology and, well, technology in general. I enjoy exploring and discovering interesting ways different technologies and modes of thinking can be combined to create new and wonderous things. Those combinations tend to be most prevalent in the most extreme environments (space being a good example).

        While my passion is outer space, the environment where I currently get to put my designs to the test isn't beyond the clouds, but rather beneath the waves.

        I currently live in San Francisco, California with my amazing wife Sasha. I have had the distinct pleasure of living in quite a few parts of the United States throughout my life (most of them during my childhood).
